# Import Hugo blog to Write.as

This tool reads a directory of Markdown files containing Front Matter, and uploads them to write.as.

hugo2writeas will likely also work for non-Hugo blogs that use similar looking Markdown files.

NOTE: See https://github.com/writefreely/hugo-importer for a more full-featured tool than this one.
